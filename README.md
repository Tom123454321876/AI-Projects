# üß¨ Breast Cancer Malignancy Predictor

A supervised machine learning project to predict breast cancer malignancy using diagnostic features from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.  
Developed as part of the AAI-500 Capstone Project ‚Äî *M.S. Applied Artificial Intelligence* ‚Äî University of San Diego.

## üìä Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)
- **Techniques Used:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Selection, Classification Modeling
- **Models Built:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, F1-score, Precision, Recall
- **Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Dropped unnecessary columns (`id`, unnamed index columns).
- Encoded categorical target variable `diagnosis`:
  - Malignant ‚Üí `1`
  - Benign ‚Üí `0`
- Verified no missing or null values remained.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Created histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and pairplots.
- Analyzed feature distributions and correlations.
- Selected top features most correlated with cancer diagnosis.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building & Evaluation
- Trained logistic regression and random forest classifiers.
- Evaluated models using:
  - Confusion Matrices
  - ROC Curves
  - Classification Reports (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
